## General Information
  - This company is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures. 
    Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface.
  - Some borrowers are risky and can result in defaulting on the loans. This results in credit loss and at the same time the company doesn't want to lose business by denying valid loans  
  - Identify applicants that are considered risky there by reducing credit loss but also not incurring business loss due by denying loans
  - A complete dataset of loan data for all loans issued between 2007 and 2011 and also the metadata describing the data are provided
